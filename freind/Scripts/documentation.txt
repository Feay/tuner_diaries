to do math you have to use short hand and always save back on to a var to it self
if you want to  $local.vec_aX+$local.vec_bX, that won't work you must  local.vec_bX-=$local.vec_aX
which is saying  local.vec_bX=$local.vec_bX-$local.vec_aX
thus destroying the orginal information.
local.vec_bX-=$local.vec_aX
global.bombarezbit=$local.vec_bX
